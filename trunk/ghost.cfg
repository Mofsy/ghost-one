### Gen OWNER PATCH (!owner or !admin) FOR TEMPOWNER IN LOBBY ###
# Owner has limited rights to do the following commands: !a, !as, !close, !closeall, !swap, !open, !openall, !holds, !hold, !unhold, !start, !startn
# set bot_tempownerinlobby=0 to disable, = 1 to initiate !owner command to normal player which means a normal player can set him/herself as an owner of the current hosting game when s/he types !owner. We allow only 1 owner in a game lobby, next player who types !owner will get error.
# However setting it = 2 for your liking of changeable owner right in lobby
# Don't set bot_tempownerinlobby = 3, as 0 <= bot_tempownerinlobby <= 2

### Gen FPs Patch ###
# bot fakes players in lobby, 0 = always disable (bot_morefakeplayersinlobby will be ignored), 1 = enable 
bot_fakeplayersinlobby = 1
# whether to allow more fakeplayers in lobby, 1= more fps will be created if less than 4 human players in lobby, 2= many more fps without that condition, 3= maximum of 3 fps refilled with that condition, 0= disable fp refilling
# bot_morefakeplayersinlobby = 3 is (preferred as) default setting in previous releases
# setting it to 3, you can still have more fps if needed by configuring maptype in mapcfgs for specific maps
# e.g. map_type = ward morefps2
bot_morefakeplayersinlobby = 1
# fakeplayers' NAMES should be less than 14 chars in fpnames.txt, without this file the bot can't work for fakeplayers adding

### Gen Patch for BAN working for Garena too ###

### Action parser (detect AFK and prevent resource trading added in Gen modded GhostOne 1.3) ###
## Available map_type for many variations:
## "2teams" "morefps1" "morefps2" "nosave" "guard" (guard means notrade, no afk & nosave) "dota" "noafk" "notrade" "nopause" "noteam" "ward" (ward means notrade & nosave but allows afk)
# take a mapcfg and add guard to map_type to enable this tool
## "noteam" Ghost bot will allow a lobby owner(known as temporary owner) to start game without having to re-balance the teams
## "2teams" Ghost bot will insistently ask the temporary owner to re-balance the game when a !startn command is sent & teams are not balanced yet
# You can have map_type = noteam ward if you want no trade, no save and no team check in lobby command

### REFRESH HACK ###
### the mapgametype overwrite (advance)
### This controls the mapgametype overwrite. Use with caution as this can result in an ipban from battle.net services or make users unavailable to join your bot with an invalid number

## Desync Reduction
#Theoretically you need to set the latency at the maximum latency (!p shows) of the players in games, but, the medium value will work too. So if the players in the game have !p - 60ms 80ms 120ms - you could try setting it at about 90 or 100.
# bot_appleicon = 0
#The synclimit it's just a value for when to show the lag screen. You should increase it a bit only if some players lag, but not too much cause either way if they are behind and have lag they will drop, regardless of the lag screen showing or not. So the latency is the most important.
