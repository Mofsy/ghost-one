(\__/)  Welcome to the Gen host
(='.'=)  Join our Group in GarenaPlus-GroupID 56934
('')_('') for numerous games!, plz speak English


here: !f (from),!checkme (do spoof-check regularly to let the system kno ur aren't fake user), !p, !ips, !open <slot> to kick a player & reserve slot for friend for example, !startn (start now), !endn (only once no hope in game don't overuse)
!close <slot> just use once needed, don't overuse, the game will never fire automatically if <8 ppls if slots closed, !startn manually in this case
otherwise let's the system do it : The game autostarts once 8 ppls are all set and autorehosts once <=3 ppls in game.

!open <slot> is mostly used to find pro ppls and stop noobies breaking in for example.
Sometimes you may nick to swap the slots, use !swap 3 5 to change ppl 3 to slot 5 for example

Believe me you just need !checkme, !open, !swap, !startn & !endn to do all the admin stuffs.
but sometimes you'd need !f & !ips to check if ppls are faking their username like hackers. In this case, plz note down their IPs & tell me to blacklist them from attacking the host & hacking the game.
