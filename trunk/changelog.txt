# Gen's MODDED Version of GhostOne @ http://thegenmaps.tk #
###########################################################

BETA VERSION 1.4b4
	=================
	v1.44
	- fix incorrect submit about GameName in r64 (v1.43), GameName should be
	correctly mapcfg like before
	- fix the same incorrect find_first_of when naming replay file
	
BETA VERSION 1.4b3
	=================
	- friend command is added to bnet.cpp, it's useful when you want your bot adds/removes some friend to the friend list
	Payload for friend command should be [add|remove|list] or [a|r|l]
		/w urbotname .friend a NAME
		/w urbotname !friend r NAME
		/w urbotname ,friend list
		(.,! is upon your bot_commandtrigger)
	- as replay issue was fixed in previous version, this release commits to name the replay files correctly, so that they can be opened
	- replay files should NOT have special chars: ï,€,$,etc.
	- bot_bnetnonadmincommands added to ghost.cfg to define what non-admin commands can be allowed.
	- bot_invalidreplaychars added to ghost.cfg to define what chars are invalid and should be removed when naming the replay file
	- USE NEW GHOST.CFG because old variables in ghostcfg are changed as following:
		+ bot_tempownerinlobby for - bot_newownerinagame
		+ bot_gamenotstartuntilXplayers for - bot_startgamewhenatleastXplayers
		+ bot_refresh for - bot_refreshduration
		+ typos in ghost.cfg are corrected
	
BETA VERSION 1.4b2
	=================

	- potentially fix replay issue
	- command !help, !helps added
	- added m_Stats to command !ff
	- bot_denypatchonjoin added to ghostcfg
	# set bot_denypatchonjoin = 0, won't affect kicking for things like long map downloads, but the deny on join will be disabled
	- map_type having dota will no longer trigger anti-parser tool(anti-save, anti-trade,etc.)
	To have the tool on, e.g. set map_type = dota guard
	
VERSION 1.4
  =================

  Adds:
    - bot_invalidtriggers to define the invalid chars for announcement: wrong command trigger.
	- bot_lobbyleaverbantime is added to ghostcfg to set timer for the BAN of leavers in lobby
	- bot_viettxt variable added to whether print a Vietnamese text in BAN announcement
  Nailed:
	- fakeplayers patch is once again nailed
	- bot_morefakeplayersinlobby variable is added to ghost.cfg to give the option for your choice of more fps in lobby
	- you can also add "morefps1" or "morefps2" to map_type for that purpose for specific maps
	- e.g. map_type = ward morefps2
	- fakeplayers' NAMES should be less than 14 chars in fpnames.txt, without this file the bot can't work for fakeplayers adding
  Fixes:
  Hopefully fix the issue about "startadvex3 failed", 
  configuring ghostcfg correctly the bot will have no more disconnection from official bnet servers
	- RefreshHack in ghostcfg:
		For the bot that host on official bnet servers:
		bot_mapgametype = 0; bot_refreshduration = 180 is the normal GhostOne refresh
			Try to change only 1 of them at a time for testing as if you wish to improve the refresh.
			OR just set it to normal GhostOne refresh for that bot.
		For a bot of yours that doesn't host on official bnet servers, 
			bot_mapgametype = 21569664 and bot_refreshduration = 0 is the best option
	- GameName in refresh will no longer exceed 31 chars, with apple icon, you should name the mapcfg within 24 chars max.
	without apple icon, 28 chars max. (11) is not counted, no worry.
	- bot refreshes GameName with $ instead of #
	- IF GameName has more than 28 chars, bot shall not add +3,+2,+1 for the vacant slots when refreshing
	- currentgames(cgames/!cg) command is fixed, no more spamming on eurobattle.net server 
	which caused the bot to be kicked by the server's anti-spam control
  Changes:
    - Filter SEND_W3GS_PLAYERINFO packet in gameprotocol.cpp for tracking possible error.
	- To prevent error with SEND_W3GS_PLAYERINFO packet, fakeplayers' names will be nailed automatically if exceed 14 chars,
	they should be 14 chars max.
	- PREVIOUS CHANGES ARE APPLIED in this v1.4

BETA VERSION 1.3b5
  =================

  Added:
	- !currentgames/!cgames/!cg command to display the games being hosted by the bot, just whisper /w botname !cg
	- !realm (for admins only) to check what realm ppls are on in the lobby (probably works in game too).
	- add refreshdelay variable to be able to disable the refreshduration, 
	bot_refreshduration = 180 or bigger number in ghost.cfg will disable the refreshhack, 
	normal gametime refresh (GetTime( ) - m_CreationTime) applied
  Changes:
	- fix version in language.cfg
	- add 1 ip (79.141.174.186|DE=from Germany) to the ipbanlist as his attempts to attack the bot with multiple names but failed & detected by deny patch
	- filter SEND_SID_STARTADVEX3 errors (startadvex3 failed) for future debugging

BETA VERSION 1.3b4
  =================

  Changes:
    - Revert MapGameType in bnet.cpp & game_base.cpp
    - Fix tempban on 127.0.0.1 in deny patch
    - minor changes
    - bot_refreshduration is added (in ghost.cfg) for defining the time for next refresh of the bot. (bot_refreshduration = 0 as default)
	
BETA VERSION 1.3b3
  =================
    
  - bot no longer spams 30000 milisecond, connection close texts heavily
  - allow multiple modes in map_type, for examples: map_type = 2teams guard, map_type = ward 2teams, map_type = noteam ward, map_type = noteam guard
  - fix: command autostart by temporary owner is working in accordance with bot_startgamewhenatleastXplayers
  - fix: text printed to 1 player instead of all players in lobby when requesting to start game but the lobby has less than bot_startgamewhenatleastXplayers value.
  - bot_startgamewhenatleastXplayers = 4. Temp owner will be disallowed to start game when <4 ppls in lobby. You can set it to other number for your liking.
  go command will still work to start game in most cases.
  - df command is fixed.

    - safelisted players will no longer be kicked by anti-spam patch

    - add more server alias
    - modify spoofcheck command to easily catch the text from players for a

    for this initial version
    ghost.exe works but isn't public for downloading
    GCBI works though there're some delays abt 30s-1min that ppls in Garena room couldn't see the host immediately.
    mrotate doesn't seem to work well and results in autorehostdelay bug (people can't see the host after rehosting #2 #3) when testing.

    # notes for latest revision
    bnet.cpp code is rolled-back to original.
    ghost.exe works
    mrotate works
    GhostOne hooking works fine.
    GCBI seems to stop working due to the changes in bnet.cpp (update 06/29/12)
