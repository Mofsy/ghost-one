# Gen's MODDED Version of GhostOne @ http://thegenmaps.tk #
###########################################################

v1.49
	=================
	Repository for decent maps storing, sharing & downloading https://decentmaps.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
	=================
	- deny_extension = 600000 (it's default value in case of missing in ghost.cfg) is added into ghost.cfg
	high deny count will now count up to 25 instead of 20
	deny_extension can take any value >=120000 miliseconds(2 mins), if you put it < 120000, the system will make it to 900000 (=15 mins).
	Deny extension is always needed to deny on join the malicious players / bot players (= who are attempting to wreck your bot). Yet if you have any problem with deny extension, just set bot_denypatchonjoin = 0, then deny on join will be disabled
	- Msg will be printed in ghostlog clearly to state what IP is under effect and for how the deny extension is in effect.
	- Russian.cfg is added, feel free to check and give feedback with new file to correct mistakes in current release of Russian.cfg
v1.48
	=================
	Repository for decent maps storing, sharing & downloading https://decentmaps.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
	=================
	- language.cfg suits you better if you want to localize the bot with your own language
	- new TOOL: Gen TEST on BroadCast Port with bot_broadcastport & bot_useportotherthan6112 added into
	Remark: new TOOL is only for users who are really used to the hosting program
			It's not recommended for newbie users
	- set bot_logreduction = 1 in ghost.cfg if you want to reduce the length of your ghostlog
	- With ghost.cfg setting, now you can make the bot to kick if player has download rate is smaller than X kb/s, set it = 0 to disable
		bot_kickifdownloadrate = 15 (15kb/s, this is to discard ppls with slow internet connection)
	Kicked player will be banned for 1 day.
			
v1.47
    =================
	Repository for decent maps storing, sharing & downloading https://decentmaps.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
	=================
    - bot_rehostchar = $ is added to ghost.cfg as for your choice on which char ($,#,or others), bot will be using to print when rehosting, e.g. GameName $32
    - Replay files are now named with version, as you may wish to run a bot for 1.24e. So you'll recognize which replays were made on 1.26 and 1.24
	# bot kick if player has download rate is smaller than 15 kb/s, set it = 0 to disable
		bot_kickifdownloadrate = 15

v 1.46
	=================
	Repository for decent maps storing, sharing & downloading https://decentmaps.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
	=================
	- TempOwner patch is once again nailed, an unlimited number of TempOwners is possible with bot_tempownerinlobby = 2
	
	GHOSTCFG add-ons:

	- bot_adminsonlan, whether to enable(default) admin players to do admin commands on LAN
	- bot_disallowdelmapbyroot & bot_disallowdlmapbyroot whether to allow rootadmins to use !delmap & !dlmap (always allow by default or =0), forbid those commands if (=1)
	- bot_neverdlmapfromepicwar & bot_onlydlmapfromhive, whether to allow map download from a source like epicwar or only Hive & https://decentmaps.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/, = 1 to enable, = 0 to disable (default)
	
	- IMPORTANT FIX: BAN CHECK is corrected for LAN & LAN ppls won't be kicked by mistake
	- some security fixes & other fixes	

v 1.45
	=================
	- add bot_replayssavedbyname to ghostcfg (see changes in ghostcfg & add bot_replayssavedbyname = 1 to ghostcfg)
	- it's possible to enable bot should name replays file by GameName first instead
	of Ghost++ as prefix by setting bot_replayssavedbyname = 1
	
BETA VERSION 1.4b4
	=================
	v1.44
	- fix incorrect submit about GameName in r64 (v1.43), GameName should be
	correctly mapcfg like before
	- fix the same incorrect find_first_of when naming replay file
	- new ELO system (uakf.b's system) for DotA games supported
	
BETA VERSION 1.4b3

		/w urbotname .friend a NAME
		/w urbotname !friend r NAME
		/w urbotname ,friend list
		(.,! is upon your bot_commandtrigger)
	- as replay issue was fixed in previous version, this release commits to name the replay files correctly, so that they can be opened
	- replay files should NOT have special chars: ï,€,$,etc.
	- bot_bnetnonadmincommands added to ghost.cfg to define what non-admin commands can be allowed.
	- bot_invalidreplaychars added to ghost.cfg to define what chars are invalid and should be removed when naming the replay file
	- USE NEW GHOST.CFG because old variables in ghostcfg are changed as following:

		+ bot_gamenotstartuntilXplayers for - bot_startgamewhenatleastXplayers
		+ bot_refresh for - bot_refreshduration
		+ typos in ghost.cfg are corrected

	- potentially fix replay issue
	- command !help, !helps added
	- added m_Stats to command !ff
	- bot_denypatchonjoin added to ghostcfg
	# set bot_denypatchonjoin = 0, won't affect kicking for things like long map downloads, but the deny on join will be disabled
	- map_type having dota will no longer trigger anti-parser tool(anti-save, anti-trade,etc.)
	To have the tool on, e.g. set map_type = dota guard
	
VERSION 1.4
  =================

  Adds:
    - bot_invalidtriggers to define the invalid chars for announcement: wrong command trigger.
	- bot_lobbyleaverbantime is added to ghostcfg to set timer for the BAN of leavers in lobby
	- bot_viettxt variable added to whether print a Vietnamese text in BAN announcement
  Nailed:
	- fakeplayers patch is once again nailed
	- bot_morefakeplayersinlobby variable is added to ghost.cfg to give the option for your choice of more fps in lobby
	- you can also add "morefps1" or "morefps2" to map_type for that purpose for specific maps
	- e.g. map_type = ward morefps2
	- fakeplayers' NAMES should be less than 14 chars in fpnames.txt, without this file the bot can't work for fakeplayers adding
  Fixes:
  Hopefully fix the issue about "startadvex3 failed", 
  configuring ghostcfg correctly the bot will have no more disconnection from official bnet servers
	- RefreshHack in ghostcfg:
		For the bot that host on official bnet servers:
		bot_mapgametype = 0; bot_refreshduration = 180 is the normal GhostOne refresh
			Try to change only 1 of them at a time for testing as if you wish to improve the refresh.
			OR just set it to normal GhostOne refresh for that bot.
		For a bot of yours that doesn't host on official bnet servers, 
			bot_mapgametype = 21569664 and bot_refreshduration = 0 is the best option
	- GameName in refresh will no longer exceed 31 chars, with apple icon, you should name the mapcfg within 24 chars max.
	without apple icon, 28 chars max. (11) is not counted, no worry.
	- bot refreshes GameName with $ instead of #
	- IF GameName has more than 28 chars, bot shall not add +3,+2,+1 for the vacant slots when refreshing
	- currentgames(cgames/!cg) command is fixed, no more spamming on eurobattle.net server 
	which caused the bot to be kicked by the server's anti-spam control
  Changes:
    - Filter SEND_W3GS_PLAYERINFO packet in gameprotocol.cpp for tracking possible error.
	- To prevent error with SEND_W3GS_PLAYERINFO packet, fakeplayers' names will be nailed automatically if exceed 14 chars,
	they should be 14 chars max.
	- PREVIOUS CHANGES ARE APPLIED in this v1.4

BETA VERSION 1.3b5
  =================

  Added:
	- !currentgames/!cgames/!cg command to display the games being hosted by the bot, just whisper /w botname !cg
	- !realm (for admins only) to check what realm ppls are on in the lobby (probably works in game too).
	- add refreshdelay variable to be able to disable the refreshduration, 
	bot_refreshduration = 180 or bigger number in ghost.cfg will disable the refreshhack, 
	normal gametime refresh (GetTime( ) - m_CreationTime) applied
  Changes:
	- fix version in language.cfg
	- add 1 ip (79.141.174.186|DE=from Germany) to the ipbanlist as his attempts to attack the bot with multiple names but failed & detected by deny patch
	- filter SEND_SID_STARTADVEX3 errors (startadvex3 failed) for future debugging

BETA VERSION 1.3b4
  =================

  Changes:
    - Revert MapGameType in bnet.cpp & game_base.cpp
    - Fix tempban on 127.0.0.1 in deny patch
    - minor changes
    - bot_refreshduration is added (in ghost.cfg) for defining the time for next refresh of the bot. (bot_refreshduration = 0 as default)
	
BETA VERSION 1.3b3
  =================
    
  - bot no longer spams 30000 milisecond, connection close texts heavily
  - allow multiple modes in map_type, for examples: map_type = 2teams guard, map_type = ward 2teams, map_type = noteam ward, map_type = noteam guard
  - fix: command autostart by temporary owner is working in accordance with bot_startgamewhenatleastXplayers
  - fix: text printed to 1 player instead of all players in lobby when requesting to start game but the lobby has less than bot_startgamewhenatleastXplayers value.
  - bot_startgamewhenatleastXplayers = 4. Temp owner will be disallowed to start game when <4 ppls in lobby. You can set it to other number for your liking.
  go command will still work to start game in most cases.
  - df command is fixed.

    - add more server alias
    - modify spoofcheck command to easily catch the text from players for a

    mrotate doesn't seem to work well and results in autorehostdelay bug (people can't see the host after rehosting #2 #3) when testing.

    # notes for latest revision
    bnet.cpp code is rolled-back to original.
    ghost.exe works
    mrotate works
    GhostOne hooking works fine.
    GCBI seems to stop working due to the changes in bnet.cpp (update 06/29/12)
